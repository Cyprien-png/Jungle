# About the project
Jungle is a single page application that has no real use. It's a simple web page through which one can scroll and observe what's going on.

## Purpose
I want to challenge myself in a field that is still completely unknown to me: 3D. Through this project I hope to learn and understand the concepts of vector calculations and how rendering engines work. 

Based on the [official three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Installation), forums and youtubes tutorials, I'm making this application an UI to which I'll be able to add modules over time to explore 3D tools, design ideas and mathematical/physical concepts.
